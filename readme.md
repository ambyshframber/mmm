# mmm

midi mapping manager

## what does it do

i thought it would be fun to make a midi patchbay entirely in a cli. so that's what this is.

mmm currently doesn't do much. you can create processors but not link them together. which is a bit shit.

## what is gen_consts.py for

i needed to generate a bunch of boring constants. const fns weren't enough, macros weren't quite suited, so i did the bad thing and used python.
